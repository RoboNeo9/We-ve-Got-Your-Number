# We-ve-Got-Your-Number
This is the program for calculating possibilites with We've Got Your Number

HOW TO EDIT STARTING NUMBERS:
-Open the file in a text editor
-set values of i1,i2,i3,i4 to whatever integers you wish

Perks:
 -Includes all functions
 -Finds ALL numbers 1-100 your list can achieve simultaneously
 -Make your list as large or small as you want! Default is 4, but program works no matter the size!
 -Pretty fast because recursion

Notation:
 log_b(a) = log base b of a
 a! = factorial(a)
 a|b = a concatenated with b
 a^b = a to the power of b
 a+b = a plus b
 a-b = a minus b
 a*b = a times b
 a/b = a divided by b
 
 NOTE: The more 3's included as starting number, the longer it will take. This is because 3,3!,3!! must all be called!
